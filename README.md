# Vehicle-Detector
Project Overview: Vehicle Counter using OpenCV and Matplotlib
This project involves implementing a vehicle detection and counting system using Python with OpenCV for computer vision and Matplotlib for visualization. The system processes a video feed of traffic to detect vehicles, track their movements, and count how many vehicles cross a predefined line.

Applications:
Traffic Monitoring: Count vehicles to analyze traffic flow and congestion.
Smart Cities: Provide data for intelligent transportation systems.
Security Surveillance: Monitor vehicle movement in restricted areas.

Tools Used:
Python Libraries:

OpenCV: For video processing, object detection, and visualizing results.
Matplotlib: For interactive plotting and visualization.
NumPy: For array manipulations and mathematical operations.
